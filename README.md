## Setup

The `Topas 4` API can be found at https://github.com/DomasM/Topas4PublicAPI/.

This repository contains the `Topas4Lib.dll` (32 bit) library. Copy this to `\Windows\SysWOW64\` so it can be found from anywhere.

## Known Issues

In the `Get Wavelength Set Status.vi` the output `IsWavelengthSettingInProgress` always returns `true`.
